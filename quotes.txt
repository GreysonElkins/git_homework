"Some people confuse inspiration with lightning not me I know it comes... at my command like a turkey club sandwich with a cup of split pea soup or tones from Benny Goodman's clarinet..." - David Lehman
"my clarinet the language that never fails to respond some people think you need to be pure of heart not true it comes to the pure and impure alike the patient and impatient the lovers the onanists and the virgins you just need to be able to listen and talk at the same time and you'll hear it like the long-delayed revelation at the end of a novel"
